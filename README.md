# Getting Started <img src="assets/images/cyan_sigil_1.png" alt="stone icon" width="25">  

### Rules
* Players must connect 4 of their pieces in a row to win, (diagonally, horizontally, vertically) while also preventing their opponent from doing so.
<br>

* On your turn, choose a column to drop your playing piece. 
    
    - If there are no pieces in the column, your piece will go to the bottom. 
    - If there are pieces and a space is left in that column, your piece will go to the space above the highest occupied space. 
    - If the column is full of pieces and there are no spaces left, you must choose a different column.
    - If there are no spaces left for any pieces, it is a tie.
